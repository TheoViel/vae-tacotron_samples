# VAE-Tacotron audio samples

## Infos

Audio samples are generated by training a  [VAE-Tacotron](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04342) on the Italian voice of Francesco Pannofino.
A [Waveglow](https://github.com/NVIDIA/waveglow) vocoder is used, to convert spectrograms to waveforms. 


## Repository structure

- `interpolation` : Contains samples generated by multiplying `z` by a scalar :
  - `gentile_1.0.wav`: Original audio, without changing `z`
  - `gentile_X.wav`: Audio obtained by multiplying `z` by `X`
  
- `generated styles` : Contains subfolders of audios generated with the same `z` but for different texts. 4 styles are available, one for each subfolder. 
The following texts are used, I report their translation as well :
  - `siera.wav` : Si era svegliato da un sogno molto vivido con il viso nascosto tra le mani. 
    - He had awakened from a very vivid dream with his face hidden in his hands. 
  - `siera_2.wav` : Si era svegliato da un sogno molto vivido  
    - He had awakened from a very vivid dream
  - `gentile.wav` : Sono molto gentile 
    - I am very nice
  - `arrabiato.wav` : Sono molto arrabiato ! 
    - I am very angry !
  - `harry.wav` : Harry era sdraiato sulla schiena, il respiro affannoso, come se avesse corso.  
     - Harry was lying on his back, breathing hard, as if he had been running.
  - `pizza.wav` : La pizza me piace molto  
    - I like pizza
  - `vita.wav`: La vita Ã¨ bella  
    - Life is beautiful
  
- `style transfer` : Compares two VAE-Tacotron models with a GST ones on the style transfer setup. 3 examples are provided, each of them contain the following files :
  - `ref.wav` : Reference audio
  - `text.txt` : Input text
  - `vae.wav`, `vae_bis.wav`, `gst.wav` : Result of the three models
